Hi Orkun,

I have worked through your comments (see attached manuscript). To respond to each one:

1. Agreed and changed

2. Agreed went with last one

3. Changed although with some alterations of my own

4. I am not sure about this people donâ€™t really use a single gene to infer function in a community, perhaps we can discuss?

5. Changed

6 Changed

7 I think metagenomics is better here since that is responsible for the novel info referred to

8 Changed this despite not changing 4 as wording still seems fine.

9 Thought it better to leave in

10 Agreed but I left in the comparison to Traitar as that is important previous work and Alice McHardy may end up a reviewer

11 Changed

12 Changed

13 Changed
